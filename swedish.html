            In the time of the Viking Age Sweden was fragmented into many petty
            kingdoms (also known as earldoms) ruled each by a local chieftain,
            although, according to semi-legendary history, there might have been
            renowned monarchs who ruled parts of the realms of what is now
            Sweden (along with Denmark and Norway) such as Ragnar Lothbrok or
            Bjorn Ironside (both allegedly belonging to the Royal House of
            Munso) at certain times. The Swedes, then known as Varangians, or
            Rus.

                Swedish Vikings also controlled trade across the Baltic, and it
                was for this activity that Birka, generally regarded as Swedenâ€™s
                oldest town, was founded Swedish Vikings took part in raids
                against western Europe as well.

                The goal of the Rus was primarily to trade (or so we think). They
                established long trade routes to the middle east and around the
                Black Sea. To this day, why this event occurred is unclear, but
                most historians believe this was a capitulation by the Slavs to
                years of raids.
