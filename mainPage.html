        Today we refer to Viking Age Scandinavians generally as Vikings as
        though they were one group. But the people known as Vikings weren’t an
        entirely homogeneous mass of people. There were Norwegian Vikings,
        Danish Vikings and Swedish Vikings (We won’t have a separate category
        for the Icelanders since they were originally Norwegian, after all, and
        didn’t really go Viking like their counterparts eastward did, they also
        developed a more settled society.
