        <p class="main_text">
          Today we refer to Viking Age Scandinavians generally as Vikings as
          though they were one group. But the people known as Vikings weren’t an
          entirely homogeneous mass of people. There were Norwegian Vikings,
          Danish Vikings and Swedish Vikings (We won’t have a separate category
          for the Icelanders since they were originally Norwegian, after all, and
          didn’t really go Viking like their counterparts eastward did, they also
          developed a more settled society.

        <h2 id="main_subtitle">General view</h2>
        <p class="main_text">
            The Vikings ventured far from their homelands in Scandinavia and
            became the first Europeans to discover Greenland and even North
            America (which they called “Vinland”) – roughly 500 years before
            Christopher Columbus. Along the way, they became the first people to
            establish sizable settlements in Iceland and other North Atlantic
            islands, and also colonized the territories their warriors conquered
            throughout northern Europe. These explorations and settlements have
            had a decisive impact upon these places that persists even today.
