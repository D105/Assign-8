Persona

Andrea is a 28 year old Italian bussiness man, who works in a company located in Italy.
Even though the company is located in Italy, they do a lot of work abroad. 
For the company's next project, they've asked Andrea to spend one year in Scandinavia.
Andrea is excited, because he has never been to scandinavia before. 
He has heard a lot about it though, and wants to find out more about the 
Scandinavian history. He reads a few articles about the history, and finds
a passage about Vikings. He is intrigued. 
During his time in Scandinavia he'll be doing a lot of traveling.
He will travel with bus, train and plane, between Norway, Denmark and Sweeden. 
He wont have much spare time, but he has decided to use the time he spends on
transportation to read about the Vikings. Since he'll be going from meeting to meeting,
he cannot drag around books and magazines about Vikings. 
Andrea needs a webpage that supplies historical information about the viking
era in Scandinavia. He needs it to be availible on mobile, since he will
be reading it while he travels. He does not want to scroll through a whole book,
but rather he wants a webpage that describes the scandinavian viking era short and
consise, with links to external resources where he can read more about 
historical aspects that he finds interesting.
